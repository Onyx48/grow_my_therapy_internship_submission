          Your past has shaped you, but it doesn't have to define your future.
          Therapy is a collaborative process where we explore your story,
          understand its impact, and empower you to make conscious choices. It's
          about building the skills and self-awareness needed to create a more
          fulfilling and intentional life, on your own terms.
